    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A very easy and delicious chicken recipe that goes well served with rice.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces and skin removed</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 apple, cored and chopped</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon curry powder, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>1 cup half-and-half cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Arrange the chicken pieces in a single layer in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Season the chicken liberally with salt, pepper, and the paprika; set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the apple and onion to the melted butter, season with the curry powder, and cook and stir until the apple and onion are tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir the mushroom soup and half-and-half into the mixture until completely combined; spoon over the chicken pieces.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 75 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
